Coding Punch-Out List App
======================
AngularJS Mini Project (January 2016)

Coded with AngularJS, JavaScript, Firebase DB, Bootstrap & HTML/CSS.

In this project, we had to design and code a project from scratch: a to-do list app.  The basic requirements for this app were:
* Users should be able to enter items they want to tackle.
* Users should be able to move them to a different location on the list. 
* Users should also be able to permantely remove items from the list.

It was completely up to the developer to come up with the look and feel of the app.

I took advantage of this exercise to explore AngularJS which I had been wanting to learn more about.  I also thought it would be fun to make this a "coding punch-out" list inspired by the Nintendo game Mike Tyson's Punch-Out which I loved playing growing up and also feel like sometimes I'm like 'Little Mac', a little guy with a lot of passion and drive, trying to knock out big coding exercises.
